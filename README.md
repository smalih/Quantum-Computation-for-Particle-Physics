# Quantum-Computation-for-Particle-Physics

I undertook a two-week research placement investigating the use of quantum computation in the field of particle physics with Dr Bipasha Chakraborty at the University of Cambridge. This placement was followed by an extensive research report on my investigation into how we can use quantum computing in conjunction with Quantum Field Theory to model the interaction of sub-atomic particles. More specifically, I discuss how I implemented quantum field theories as quantum circuit gates which I simulated inside a Jupyter notebook using Qiskit. I also performed linear regression to determine the best fit of a dataset. Using this model, I was able to extrapolate and find the theoretical value of a physical property. This is the repo where I store all the code used during this placement, and my final research report.
